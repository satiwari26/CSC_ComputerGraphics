# myWebsite Layout
1. Used pure Html, CSS and javascript to implement the responsive website with cool canvas look. 
2. Used circle collision algorithm to detect if any particles are colliding and change their trjactory with the help of cursor coordinates.
3. All the graphics and images used in the website are designed by me with the help of photoshop and lightroom.

## Future Updates.
1. The plan is to transform the website to a React application, with better user interface and better user experience.
2. Some additional components and projects are needed to be updated. 
3. A lot of hardware projects are to be added with reports in IEEE format.
