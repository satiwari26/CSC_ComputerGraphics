## Experience finding the Obj
- Finding the 3d obj files was really hard, there were some of the elements that I found fairly easily such as car, background etc.
- Finding the batman, city and other stuff related to batman was specially really hard and I couldn't figure out what else to include to make it such that it looks cool at the same time it potrays the story that I want to show.
- I think the generic objects are really easy to find but more specific obj are really complicated and hard to find so people have to dig more deep into it to be able to work with it.
